## Selective Project Demo
**[osu! Gameplay & Business Data Analysis](https://github.com/Alan0329/osu_analysis)**  
osu! is a popular free rhythm game for Windows, launched in 2007 by peppy and collaborators. It features four main modes — osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania — each offering unique gameplay based on rhythm and precision.
In this project, I assume the role of a data analyst for the osu! team, aiming to provide insights that **enhance player experience and support sustainable community-driven growth through data analysis**. The project explores ways to optimize gameplay engagement and improve the team’s operational motivation through data-informed strategies.
